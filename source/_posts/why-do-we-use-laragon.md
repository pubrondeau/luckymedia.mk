Laragon is a very fast and powerful local development environment. If we need a local server for our application, we can simply use Laragon. We can use Xampp, Wamp, Docker, Vagrant, Homestead, etc.

Laragon is very lightweight and uses less than 4MB RAM when running. It uses pretty URLs, itâ€™s portable, isolated and easy to use. Maybe you want to make a Wordpress site, just start Laragon go to Menu -> Quick App -> Wordpress, done. You can also do the same process for creating Joomla, Prestashop, Drupal, Laravel, CakePHP and Symfony applications in a minute.

Laragon includes databases such as MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL & MongoDB and it provides development environments for PHP, Node.js, Python, Java, Go and Ruby. If you want to access the database you can use the Database button and it will open it. Then, you can manipulate with your database directly and save the changes.
